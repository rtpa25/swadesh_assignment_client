## Local Setup

    flutter pub get
    flutter run

This will install all the dependencies and start the app on your device or emulator. I have built the entire app using my smart phone as the emulator. If you want to do so [better than emulator] please make sure that your smart phone and your computer are connected to the same network. Also, make sure that you have enabled the developer options and USB debugging on your smart phone.
